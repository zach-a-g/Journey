# Week Three of Coding Bootcamp

This week has had a primary learning focus on HTML and CSS. These topics are some of the ones that I found most interesting coming into the cohort and I have been really enjoying everything we've learned so far. Something that I have been surprised about is what my thinking process is every time I pull up a website now. Before the class, I never really paid attention to anything outside of if the site worked or not. Now, I find myself constantly inspecting every page I pull up and taking note of neat functions and layouts. Some of these function I find I have actually applied them in a similar way to some of my personal projects and have really liked the outcome.

## Highs and Lows of Week 3

Starting off with the low, I think my biggest challenge this week has been how tricky setting up page layouts is and making everything work properly. An example of this would have to be my experience creating a navigation bar for my mock instagram page. For what I am trying to replicate, finding the right combination of width, margin, and layering items on top of each other has been a very frustrating process. I am quickly learning that it is easy to make one tiny change and it leads to a waterfall of various problems.

My high for this week would have to be from this past Monday when we presented our completed python RPG project. My group and I worked really hard on it, and we were able to combine all of our work through Github. some examples of this project can be found in my repos under "Pokemon-RPG", or from last week's journal entry. Another high for me would have to be the amount of progress I've made in such a short amount of time. Having no coding experience before this class, I feel that I have already come a long way.
