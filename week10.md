# Week 10 of Coding Bootcamp

## My Decision on DigitCrafts Bootcamp

My overall decision on choosing DigitalCraft to learn how to code has been one that I know I will never regret. The information and tools that I've learned up to this point have been mind blowing to me in that just 10 weeks ago, I knew NOTHING about coding. Now I can say I know how to assemble a good-looking full-stack development website in just a few days. I still have such a long way to go, and I know the learning will never stop, but I am confident knowing that I started my foundation at DigitalCrafts. Seeing on how happy and interactive the alumni are here, I know I can always count on DigitalCrafts even after a complete the cohort.

## Week 10 Content

This week consisted of just working on our back end projects. Our topic was focused around putting together a travel planning website that had the capability for the user to keep track of trips with specific details. In order to accomplish this, we created an express app that communicated with a database in order to fetch, add and delete the users content. We then used this information to data map an easy to read itinerary that the user could use on their trip! This project was completed on a shorter time span than I had hoped for, but I'm happy with what we were able to put together. Examples of this project can ber seen below:
