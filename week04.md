# Week 4 of Coding Bootcamp

As the weeks go by, I am excited to see how far I've come. I am always thinking of what I can make with the skills I am learning and what I would change in apps and websites that I currently use. One app idea that I am always thinking about is an inventory app that would have been incredibly helpful for the last position I was in at the Houston Texans.

The problem I was always running into there was that our organization did not have a process in place to track, reserve and order items out of our warehouse. Before I left to come to DigitalCrafts, we searched for months for a solution, but struck out with anything that truly fit our needs. I am genuinely thrilled to know that once I am done with this class, I will have the skills to put something together that I may be able to present to them and for them to use for years to come.
