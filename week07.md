# Week 7 of Coding Bootcamp

This week was the beginning of learning Express and Node, and also the beginning of of class really starting to ramp up! This was pretty evident for me, especially seeing how I often found myself playing catch-up with our daily code-alongs. 

## Looking Back

When I think back on ev everything I've learned so far, I am really surprised and happy with what I've accomplished. With regards to what I think I prefer more, I feel that my interest is more drawn towards front-end than back-end. This is sort of an open statement though, as I have yet to really learn what back-end is all about. I have been working on my own project on the side since the beginning of class, and I have been excited about seeing my idea come to life. While working on this though, I find myself asking/googling a lot of questions about how to make my application work. Most, if not all, of these questions get answered with work being done on the back-end. Since I am determined to see this application come to life, I have a feeling I may find myself like back-end more. I started this class saying that I wasn't too creative, but I have come to love letting my creative juices flow. Who's to say the same situation doesn't happen with back-end development?
